		<intro>
			You walk into class, and Steve, the professor, calls you over.			
			"How's it going? Good? Great! Just to let you know, You're
			your new group leader. Don't think it means anything, all it
			means is you're the new group leader. By the way, are you
			ready for your demo today?"

			You still have a few minutes before you have to demo, you
			should get a laptop and use it in this room!
		</intro>
		<cont>
			"Are you ready for your demo?" Steve asks.

			You better find a laptop and use it in this room!
		</cont>
		<done>
			Due to the fact that you had no idea what you were 
			supposed to be demoing, your demo did not go too well.
			However, your stories miraculously got approved. Now all you
			have to do is turn it in. How hard could that be?

                <intro>
			Steve addresses the whole class now.
			"Ok everyone, do your sprint retrospective and turn in your
			notecards."

			Notecards? Forget the retrospective, you had better quickly
			find 5 notecards!

                <cont>
                        You don't have your 5 notecards yet, so you probably shouldn't 
			talk to Steve yet.
                </cont>
                <done>
                        You got your notecards turned in just before the bell. Now
			for the pull request!
