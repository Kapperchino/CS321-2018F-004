		Its really important to function as a team."

		You make a poor excuse, and quickly walk away.

                You talk to Patty, who informs you that the project is going
		south because the different teams have no communication, and
		your own team never does the daily standups. You decide that
		daily standups are unnecessary, but should probably get some
		communiction going with other teams. Sarah is unlikely to
		cooperate, but if you can get Chris to work with you, the
		next merge should be a lot easier. Maybe you could contact
		him over Piazza?
